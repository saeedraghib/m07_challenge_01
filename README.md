# *ETF Analyser - (m07_challenge_01):*<br><br>

## **Description:**<br>
In recent years, finance has had an explosion in passive investing. Passive investing means that you invest in a basket of assets that’s called an exchange-traded fund (ETF). This way, you don’t spend time researching individual stocks or companies or take the risk of investing in a single stock. ETFs offer more diversification.

This project is designed to perform the following tasks:
<br>

### ***Part 1: Analysis*** <br>

### ***Task 1:***<br>
Analyze a single asset in the ETF.
<br>
### ***Task 2:***<br>
Optimize Data Access with Advanced SQL Queries.
<br>
### ***Task 3:***<br>
Analyze the ETF Portfolio.
<br>
<br>

### ***Part 2: Web Application***<br>
Once all the analysis is completed, Jupyter notebook is deployed as a Web Application. The Voila Library is used to create the web component of the solution.
For this section, web application screen shots are in the screenshots folder.
